# Exercise 12.2
#
#
# Grading Guidelines:
# - No answer variable is needed. Grading script will call function.
# - Function "anagram_finder" should return a list of of all the sets of 
# words that are anagrams.
# - Function "anagram_finder2" should return a list of of all the sets of 
# words that are anagrams in ascending order by number of anagrams. 
# - Function "anagram_bingo" should return a list containing the collection 
# of 8 letters that forms the most possible bingos
#
# 1. Write a function named "anagram_finder" that reads a word list 
# from a file and returns a list of all the sets of words that are anagrams.
# 
# Here is an example of what the output might look like:
# [
#   ['deltas', 'desalt', 'lasted', 'salted', 'slated', 'staled'],
#   ['retainers', 'ternaries'],
#   ['generating', 'greatening'],
#   ['resmelts', 'smelters', 'termless']
# ]
#
# Hint: you might want to build a dictionary that maps from a collection of 
# letters to a list of words that can be spelled with those letters. The 
# question is, how can you represent the collection of letters in a way that 
# can be used as a key?
#
#
# 2. Create a modified function of the above named "anagram_finder2" so that it 
# prints the longest list of anagrams first, followed by the second longest, 
# and so on.
# 
#
# 3. In Scrabble a "bingo" is when you play all seven tiles in your rack, along 
# with a letter on the board, to form an eight-letter word. Write a function
# named "anagram_bingo" that returns a list containing the collection of 8
# letters that forms the most possible bingos. Hint: there are seven.
